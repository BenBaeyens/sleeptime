## Short Description
The Sleeptime app is an app that allows you to see which times you have to wake up or go to bed for an ideal night's rest!
Based on studies 
> A quick, one day build to help maintain a better sleep habit!

## Why I made the app
I always try improving the things that are not going well in life, and since I was always tired in the morning, I decided to make an app to help me sleep better, and I think many others will find it useful too!
This project was a one-day build to test my skills in programming as well as UI/UX design. I will, however, continue to update the projects throughout the upcoming weeks/months as necessary to patch bugs and add features. 

## What I learned from this project
With every project I do, I hope to learn something from it. This was especially true for this project as this app is the first app I ever made.
I learned a lot of things ranging from coding to graphical design, such as:
- Writing clean code, even on a tight time schedule 
- Using the skills I learned to make functional software
- Designing a user interface from top to bottom, from scratch.

I also learned some other skills, like:
- Use the Unity animation tool
- Learned to further use Unity's UI tools

Overall, this project was very helpful towards developing my skillset and expanding my portfolio for future use.

## What I would change
> If I were to start the project all over again, what would I do differently, what would I change?

- I struggled with the animations for quite some time since I never got them quite right. Since this was merely an excercise, I think I would do much better on my next app, in regards to animating.

- Researching how Unity copes with different screen resolutions. I had to re-do some parts because of the graphical bugs that would occur on a different screen resolution.
